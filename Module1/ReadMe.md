#Exercises

#Debugging
Import the project Debugging in Module 1.
Use the Debugger built into your IDE to find and fix all the bugs in the code.

####Tips
* Use breakpoints to pause execution when the code reaches a certain statement in your code.
* Inspect variables to make sure that the code is doing what it's supposed to.
* Your debugger isn't the only debugging tool you have. Rubber duckies can also be super helpful :)

#Unit Testing
Complete and write tests to cover methods in the UnitTesting project.
