# Adding libraries to your project

This is fairly simple to do. First, you need to create a `libs` folder in your project.
Do this by `right clicking on your project folder`, under `new` select `folder` and give it the name `libs`.
Next, download the `*.jar` file for whatever library you want to include and copy it into the `libs` folder.
Finally, you add it to the `Build path`, by right clicking the `*.jar` under  Build path, select add to build path.
You can now use classes contained in the jar like you would any other classes in your program with the necessary import
statements.
